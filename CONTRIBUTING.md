<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ol>
<li>File an issue to notify the maintainers about what you're working on.</li>
<li>Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes, add docs.</li>
<li>Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.</li>
<li>Send a pull request.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Fork the Repository</h2>
<p>Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request. Docs will be<br>
updated automatically when we merge to <code>master</code>, but you should also build<br>
the docs yourself and make sure they're readable.</p>
<h2>Make the Pull Request</h2>
<p>Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation,<br>
make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the<br>
<code>repository</code>. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request.<br>
Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these<br>
rules.</p>
