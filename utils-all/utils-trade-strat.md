# TRADING STRATEGY

## DIARY

-   Accept small win to reduce risk
-   Systematic model Backtested & Follow it
-   Never precipitate to enter a trade (FOMO)
-   Don't hesitate to double or triple on breakout validation
-   Follow long term trendline and close winning trade on a resitance trend line and rebuy if breakout appear.
-   Close winning especially if you are surexposed, you can also close to do a rotation.
-   Place your stop loss at entry point (no sure)
-   Minimum time market buy stop & quick take profit (no sure)
-   Manage risk according to current volatily & current other assets (indices, vix, spread)
-   Use put option for shorting, risk is limited compared to a trad short position.

## RULES

0.  identify the trend a level to confirm it
1.  wait 1 trading day before buying or selling a thing
2.  sell half on a double (100%)
3.  buy value / be contrarien
4.  be skeptikal 
5.  the smaller the better (small portfolio under 10)
6.  don't speculate with mortage payment
7.  don't be afraid to sell (understand flaw)
8.  read the positive and negative (confirmation biasis)
9.  do not listen others people (your own opinion is the most)
10. diversification (10 cryptos + 10 stocks (better to use ETF))
11. be consistant over the long term, good health, wake up early, eat clea, do sport, it will be your best hedge against others people

## ALGOTRADE ADVICE

-   A system is good enough if yearly gain above max drawdown
-   Check the biggest gainers and biggest loosers to make sure it works as expected
-   Do walk forward analysis which is like a backtesting but taking out of samples data in the next period after your backtest optimisation, for instance if you have 4 years of data, optimise for the first year and then backtest for the next year and so on until the last year.
-   Do monte carlo simulation to shuffle your trades and see if they will survive based on your risk and capital
-   Do System Parameter Permutation (SPP) (by Dave Walton), the idea is to filter robust strategies by looking at the distribution of the optimization results and see how your strategy compare to that median of the distribution. 
-   When you have a new system but it on incumbation period and check it few months later to see how it behaves
-   Do not suroptimize with the best performance instead you should manually decide a range of value that makes sense to follow your thesis and then backtest a parameter range of 10% by 10% and then see the statistical distribution of the performance and so on for the next parameters. Finally when you run all tests a ratio of 66% of positive tests is a good result; on the contratry a bad system can be detected if only few of the parameters results in a positive performance.
-   You can add more logic to a system like a trend filter if the average of the backtests have good results
-   Do not run only one optimized system but try to run three or four times the same system with different set of well distributed parameters. this will stabilize dramatically the returns in live trading.
-   The holy grail is to have a set of uncorrelated strategies which makes gains stable and smooth equity curves : trend following, mean reversion, volatility, arbitrage...

## COMMON STRATEGY

-   Range bounds - buy low - sell high

-   Breakout of a range to profit from the birth of a new trend

-   Trend following (temporary pause and bet on continuation of main trend) the probability of win increase when the momentum is growing, you can filter assets by momentum/ROC and keep only the strongest momentum it will automatically do a rotation on the assets you trade. relative momentum is compared to others assets. absolute momentum is pure ROC

-   mean reversion is to detect when the price move short term in the opposite direction of the main trend (strong trend) and then bet the price will go back in trend. buy as price drop and you can scale in when price continue to drop. don't wait too many confirmation else you will miss.

-   mean reversion to capitalize on extreme changes for instance when standard deviation > 2 or 3 then we are going to have a mean reversion to the MA

-   volatility trading is taking a position based on the future expected volatility for instance using the VIX 

-   <https://www.composer.trade/learn/examples-of-best-algorithmic-strategies>

## STOP LOSS/EXIT

-   gradual approach in reducing their position. If itâ€™s a momentum trade they put the max size on and reduce gradually as the trade moves against them

## PRICE & VOLUME

-   check different timeframes (H4,D,W) are aligned with your trend
-   uptrend & upday > volume higher
-   uptrend & downday > volume lower
-   downtrend & upday > volume lower
-   downtrend & downday > volume higher
-   <https://youtu.be/Lz1Sg1fD7BA?t=111>
-   <https://youtu.be/m8F3KkBDtC0>

## FILTER STRATEGY

-   detect the asset to focus on for a swing (3 days to 30 days)
-   the best TA pattern
-   the best risk/rewards ratio
-   take position and wait confirmation

## VWAP

-   <https://twitter.com/stephenharlinmd/status/1630682949292027906>

## CRYPTO STRATEGY

-   sell at resistance and get usd or the other pair
-   sell only 25% / 50% and divide in many other main assets: usd, btc, eth
-   buy at support with the other currency 
-   keep 10% of the portfolio in usd to buy the dips
-   buy at the sound of the cannon sell at the sound of the violin
-   place order at low price in usd(x) pairs with low liquidity
-   rise duration is between 40 and 60 days and 10 to 14 are parabolic
-   then we have a range

## LEVERAGE

-   leveraged position can be good only after a big correction like minus 30% and use only a small leverage such as x2 or x3, it will helps reduce your stress. And also it's good to keep legeraged open positions only the minimum amount of times because most of the time you have to pay fees everyday

## SKEW

Skewness is a statistical measure of the asymmetry of the returns in a frequency histogram. Bitcoin  
returns exhibit a positive skew (right-skew). This becomes especially apparent when compared to other assets. This is where the tail is longer on the right-hand side and indicates the greatest benefit of Bitcoin as an investment vehicle,  
especially in the longer (1-month) timeframe.

## TURNING POINT

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-C9uVyZmOI> The Bear Market Ended Months Ago, Says Master of Turning Points | Milton Berg

-   turning point: the 5 days ROC of the SP500 at major market lows has nearly always exceeded 7.4%. This time in June 2022 it was 6.4%. You can also combine with 3 days ROC above 6% and 5 days ROC greatest in 2 years.

-   the market makes low historically and we can use a threshold of 3.75% so price never goes below 3.75% of the previous low. it's just a retest. ex in SP500 we had initial test in september 30th and second on october 12th 

-   momentum indicator: historically SP500 has gained 7.4% at a minimum within the first months or two of a major market low, usually it's even faster: less than 10 days.

-   TRIN indicator is a measurement of downside volume versus upside volume, ie number of stocks that traded up and down in the day, in other words it measures the severity of upside volume or downside volume relative to the daily number of advancing stocks to declining stocks, it's a ratio of the number of stock down to number of stocks up. A TRIN above 1 means that there is more volume in down stocks on relative base to up stocks. A TRIN below 1 means there is more volume in up stocks than there is in down stocks. the idea of turning point is to look at extremes of the TRIN. On October 3th 2022 we had a TRIN above 4 and TRIN above 4 was only 10 times before in history of SP500 and each time except one a major bull followed with median gain of 21.5% in 12 months. It's a panic selling at the end of the move, at the end of the bear market.

-   another solution is to simply measure difference of upside volume vs downside volume (volume in stocks that are up on the day versus volume in stocks that are down in the day) so for instance on october 4th there was 293 times as much volume in the upside versus downside, so it was reversal, after panic selling, panic buying. a good threshold is to use 100 times upside vs downside in SP500. it happened 4 times and medium return was 30% in 12 month.

-   Another indicator is to check on the 500 stocks of the SP500 are at 3 days high. How often we see more than 90% of the 500 stocks closing at 3 days high

-   the best time to buy stock is during a recession, the worst time to buy stock is when the market is anticipating recession

## INDICATORS

## classic:

-   21 EMA DAILY

## Rsi:

-   bullish if price is above the weelkly 21 MA (if it hold above it's bullish)
-   bullish if price is bellow the weelkly 21 MA (if it hold below it's bearish)
-   adx is below 20 then it's a ranging cycle (choppy)
-   adx is above 20 then it's a trending cycle (directionnal)

## Strat: Rsi long term

-   When RSI (14 period or more) goes below 45 on a daily timeframe it's bearish. (below 30 hyper bearish but also expect big reverse)
-   When RSI (14 period or more) goes above 55 on a daily timeframe it's bullish. (above 70 hyper bullish but also expect big reverse)

## Strat: Rsi short term

-   When RSI (2 or 3 period) goes below 10 or 20 bullish and bearish when RSI goes above 80 or 90. it works well on indices like SPX500 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo62oiT0xdg>

## Strat: Rsi trend following

-   Tested on BTC
-   Entry: RSI(7) > 80 AND MA(BTC,50) > C
-   Exit: RSI(7) &lt;70
-   <https://robuxio.com/algorithmic-crypto-trading-xii-building-a-profitable-crypto-trading-strategy/>

## Strat: Breakout

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7gzyEnPTwg> Breakout Trading using the Richard Donchian Channel strategy
-   this system inspired many strategies like the turle trader
-   buy breakout meanining buy when close of today is higher than the high of X days (X can be 10/20/50)
-   sell when price close below the low of Y days (Y is generally shorter than X above) (Y can be 7/10/20)
-   according to Joachim Moser it's more profitable buy retest of breakout using another algorithm. buy when we did new high in the last X days and when RSI 7 periods &lt; 20 or 30. it means there is a retest.

## Strat: bollinger bands: width

Buys when Band Width reaches 20-day low and EMA1 > EMA2.  
Shorts when Band Width reaches 20-day low and EMA1 &lt; EMA2.  
Exits position when EMA reverses.

## Strat: bollinger bands: breakout

Buy/short when price moves outside of the inner band (m1).  
Exit when the price moves into the inner band or to the outer bound (m2).

-   <https://raposa.trade/blog/4-simple-strategies-to-trade-bollinger-bands/>

## Strat: bollinger bands: squeeze and expansion

-   For entry, we will use a break out of the Upper Band > Daily candle closes above Bollinger Bands (20, 2) and For exit: Daily candle closes below the 20-day moving average.
-   To measure volatility we can use the difference between the upper and the lower band of the indicator.  The larger the difference, the higher the volatility and vice versa. Use it to add a filter: We take a 100 day moving average of the difference between the upper and lower band and compare it to the difference on the day of a potential breakout. for instance today's difference between the upper and lower bands is 50% higher than the average difference over the last 100 days. This means that the market is really volatile, indeed once volatility arises, tends to continue to rise. So it is worth betting on this increase and trading breakouts.
-   So this filter probably works. We can verify it by reversing the condition. We will only enter if today's difference is 30% lower than the 100-day average. to confirm your assumption this should mae the results worse than with no filter and also worse than with high volat flter.
-   Pavel | Robuxio <https://twitter.com/PKycek/status/1646482934201720835?s=20>

## Strat: Vix

-   buy SP500 when VIX closes above 30 and sell when VIX closes below 20. = +25% in 2022
-   buy SP500 when VIX closes below 20 and sell when VIX closes above 30. = -33% in 2022

## Strat: mean reversion: one day by @thechartist

-   Take ATR of last 5 days.
-   Take std dev of the ATR for 50 days and divide by std dev of the last 200 days
-   If less than 5 then buy limit at todays low minus the ATR 5 \* 0.5
-   Exit at close, apply to all US stocks in uptrend above 20$ and with t/o > 300k
-   other mean reversion: 
-   <https://www.quantifiedstrategies.com/3-free-mean-reversion-trading-strategies/>
-   <https://wealth-lab.com/Strategy/DesignPublished?strategyID=51>

## Strat: mean reversion: 4 days consecutive

-   4 days consecutive green candle then buy long
-   4 days consecutive red candle then sell short
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpkCxEUdoMo>

## Strat: mean reversion: close at high

-   inspired by Larry Connors
-   close is highest close of X previous bars then sell short 
-   close is lowest close of X previous bars then buy long
-   exit at first profitable close or stop loss 250 pips
-   add ATR(14) to trade only if below level of volatility
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVEbnqLk0-Q>
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMXUMjckVhU>

## Strat: mean reversion: spread / stretch / deviation of MA

-   Day Trading Legend: BNF, contrarian strategy looks at stock deviating at least 20% below 25days MA, with 35% safe level to buy. The % level actually depends on the sector, like high risk startup or crypto will have a very spread like between 28 and 60%. Also during a strong bull market, if you are late to the party you can still buy the lagger values (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnc77gMihPo>) <https://youtu.be/LyeJ-CM980I> (REFS2)

## Strat: Trend following: by Laurens Bensdorp

-   Liquidity: only very liquid stocks
-   Close of the SPY needs to be above the 50 day SMA + 2 ATR (20 days)
-   Close of the stock is the highest close of the last 50 days
-   We trade a maximum of 10 positions (stocks)
-   if more candidates, we rank by highest ROC of the last 50 days
-   Exit rule: initial stop at 5 ATR (20) below the execution price + trailing stop 17.5%
-   Detail: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5tW_tNzZ7M>
-   However based on Joachim Moser, trend following systems are not very good because they consumes equity base / time invested in the market, so he recommend instead mean reversion strategy.

## Strat: Trend following: check

-   use the different variants of MA like the TEMA, the WEMA
-   <https://youtu.be/3QInwRFOnj8>

## Strat: Trend following: 3 ema

-   Enter when the 3 moving average are aligned: 50 > 100 > 200 and close crosses the 50 
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbCWVxlaq14>

## Strat: Trend following: 3 ema slingshot

-   Slinghot is when the price close above the EMA 4 bars of the bar highs
-   <https://youtu.be/YArWpO2YOuI>
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfVAuxRRUwY>

## Strat: Trend following: 2 Super Trend

-   Simply combine two super trends indicators to buy only when both are on the good side and inverse for sell
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-LmElNl7co>
-   <https://youtu.be/UFrNk2NOgi0>

## Strat: Trend following: momentum ROC

-   use smoothed rate of change (SROC), its simply a ROC with an EMA/SMA to smooth and remove noise
-   dual momentum: absolute using SROC on the asset and relative compared to others assets
-   pick the top asset sorted by SROC (ROC perid/length between 20 to 100 bars)
-   use the momentum as exit, for instance when SROC starts to go down or goes below a filter MA
-   trends is your friend until it bends
-   <https://youtu.be/HL-7skV0f-s>

## Strat: Trend following: momentum simple

-   adx(14) > 10 and close-close[65] crosses above 0 then buy long
-   adx(14) > 10 and close-close[65] crosses below 0 then sell short  
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajZSkslriXg>

## Strat: Trend following: momentum breakout

-   when close crossed above the 100 day high of the close we go long
-   when close crossed below the 100 day low of the close we go short
-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NWcKpupjJo&t=214s>

## Strat: Trend following: Bull market vs bear

The bull signal is the following: 18 consecutive closes above the 200 SMA in a bear market. After the bull market signal, the forward returns tend to be pretty strong. The market is up 21.84% on average one year after the signal is triggered.

-   <https://www.quantifiedstrategies.com/bull-market-signal/>

## Strat: Equity Curve Trading Strategy

-   Skipping trades when equity curve is above a moving average of equity
-   Skipping trades when equity curve is below a moving average of equity
-   Skipping trades after consecutive winning trades
-   Skipping trades after consecutive losing trades
-   Skipping based on net profit
-   Skipping based on rolling Sharpe Ratio
-   detail: <https://www.buildalpha.com/equity-curve-trading/>
-   however based on Joachim Moser, it's very complex thing to do, and so not recommended because often at the end often arrives a very profitable trades you don't want to miss.

## Strat: Multi time frame strategy

-   <https://www.pyquantnews.com/the-pyquant-newsletter/backtest-powerful-intraday-trading-strategies>
-   VectorBT Pro

## INFLATION/DEFLATION

-   when bonds are crashing then interest rates are rising => we are going towards inflation

-   when bonds are rising then interest rates are crashing => we are going towards deflation

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e5LyYzTK4M>

## VOLATILITY

-   when the volatility is high it's risky so just do day-trading and secure gain after few hours
-   when the volatility is low it's safe so just do swing-trading and secure gain after few days

## MOMENTUM

Momentum is the speed or velocity of price changes in a stock, security, or tradable instrument.

## TREND

-   bull market usually takes many years (24 months to 72 months)
-   bear market usually takes few months (8 months to 18 months)
-   you can make more money in bear (assets falls 7 times faster than they rise)
-   then you have a lot of money to buy the bottom with simple technical analysis
-   you can focus on stock which offers a very good dividends (7/10 percents)

## DUMB MONEY

-   they usually do trend following strategy and the issue arises when they become so confident that they establish their largest long positions after markets have rallied hard and their smallest after markets have declined. so they are most exposed at the peak and the least at the bottom. we can also call ignorant money.

## GAPS

-   gap downs have a higher proba of filling than gap ups
-   gap on individual stocks are not good for trading
-   gap on indices are good for trading, much more probability

## INDICATOR

-   correlation: helps to be more accurate and eliminate false signals: gold/silver | gdx/sil | btc/eth | s&p/nasdaq
-   forces: longer it remains near support the more dangerous it becomes
-   ratio: rendement potentiel / risque (Sharpe et Sortino)
-   diversification: reduction risque

## TAKE PROFIT

-   short models turns flat if SP500 fall > -9% during the past 3 sessions.
-   long models turns flat if SP500 rise > x% during the past 3 sessions.

## RANGE

-   ADX &lt; X (like 25) / MMI (Market Meanness Index) / Momersion indicator / MA slope

-   If volatility is low, don't trade. Measure it as low ATR or narrow BB bands width etc

-   <https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-reduce-whipsaws-in-a-moving-average-based-trading-system>

## WHIPSAWS

The classic moving average is generating a lot of whipsaws so you can add an extra filter to get rid of these false signals.

-   Ranging: The market is ranging you can ignore the signal to avoid the whipsaw.

-   Extent: The price has to surpass an additional upper band & lower band in order to trigger the signal, the upper and lower can be generated using different ways: adding x percent of the moving average (ex: Percentage Price Oscillator) or the moving average of the high/low. It can also be a classic bollinger band, an enveloppe or a keltner channel. Another solution is to have x percent of some other measure, such as the trading range (high/low) of the past y days.

-   Extreme sentiment: In an uptrend crossover, the low has to surpass the moving average and not just the close; in a downtrend, the high has to be under the moving average, and not just the close.

-   Time: The close has to remain above (or below) the moving average for an additional x number of periods after the crossover date.

-   Volume: The crossover has to be accompanied by a significant rise in volume.

-   Smoothing: The shortest the moving average you use the more you will have whipsaws. so in this case you can smooth your signal by adding a first very short moving average (5 period) to the price and then calculate your initial moving average using this smoothed one.

## OBV

Everyone uses the RSI, but most people are sleeping on the OBV. Bad idea. OBV divergences and support/resistance are more reliable than on the RSI and it's breakout often precede price breakout.

## FRACTALE

-   when the trend is positive on many timeframes (at least 3): m15,h1,h4,d,w,m

## ORDER

-   Those are not even recommended. In general, limit orders can result in unrealistic backtests due to liquidity constraints. If the limit is reached you may not be able to execute 1/10 of your size without impact. Market markets won't make it easy for you. In fact,  they will take the other side. The backtest may show a 1% gain for a trade, but the real gain maybe 0.01% or even a loss. 

## MONEY MANAGEMENT / RISK MANAGEMENT

-   measure the risk before an entry: % Distance from long MA. Could also be high ATR, bands etc.

-   <https://youtu.be/I5p2Hg9s-64> Should You Trade Trend Following Or Mean Reversion Strategies?

## STRATEGY ALGO REFS

-   REFS1: #MOMENTUM / #TREND dayback=65, stoploss, takeprofit. Buylong when adx(14)>10 and close-close[dayback] crosses above 0. Sellshort when adx(14)>10 and close-close[dayback] crosses below 0
-   REFS2: emastretch mean reversion strategy. emastretch = 100 _ (Close / EMA(10) - 1). buylevel = Close - ATR(5) _ 0.75
-   REFS3: #1 RSI(2) below 5 | #2 Sum of RSI(2) over the past 2 days &lt; 20 | #3 Lower low 3 days in a row | #4 Lower close 3 days in a row | #5 Close lower than the lower low of past 5 days | #6 Market closes 1% below previous day close and atr(5) greater than atr(10) (increased volatility) | #7 Market closes 1% below previous day close and atr(5) lower than atr(10) (decreased volatility) | #8 Closes stretches below ema(5) more than 50% of atr(5) | #9 Closes stretches 1% below of ema(5) | #10 ema(5) decreases by 0.5% compared to previous day.... Best are #7, #2, #8
-   REFS4: GBPJPY 1H timeframe is a trending forex pair and correct timeframe; Buy long when Close above Upper BB(100, 3) (100 hours and 3 std dev) and opposite for shorts, taget 450 pips, stop 190 pips
-   REFS5: use monthly chart and buy long after 2 consecutive close above the SMA(12) and exit when close below the SMA(12), works very well on SPY, APPLE, AMZN, GME
-   REFS6: turtle is a momentum strategy and the rules are buy long on breakout of 20 or 55 days, hard stop using atr(x) \*2, add to positions after new breakout

## TODO: NOTES

-   preset for binaryhlc and start coding the hlc2 with more idea on it like grid multi position or divergance MIN(10) > MIN(20) and 3 consecutive close
-   continue work on ROC, find improvement to close better, like the BREAKOUT (ema?)
-   backtest my first Multi Timeframe Psych with rules long only if close > 2 bands
-   reorganize different RSI stategies : RSI3X; RSIRANGE, RSIPULLBACK, RSIMR (Lefort), STOMR (Lefort)
-   try another approach: ex: insidebar strategy using the robuxio book or 
-   try another approach : co intregration to do arbitrage on 2 correlated pairs.
-   MR with BB or lorentzian or RSI

## TODO: NOTES: ADX

-   continue work on ADX: add input for momentumTrigger to allow keep position open if adx above this level, probably momentum is strong so it should not exit + add input for emaExit + add input for isRisingAdx
-   add option to use different MA twpe: exponential; ALM;...
